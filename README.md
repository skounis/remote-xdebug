# Remote Xdebug
Debug a remote server with XDebug.

## Overview 
The IDE (e.g. PHPStorm) is runnung in the local machine and is listeing for XDebug connections from a remote server. 

XDebug port: `9000` 

### Establish and test an SSH tunnel. 
Redirecting all requests from the server that come to port `9000` to the local machine on port `9000`

```
ssh -R 9000:localhost:9000 server_ip_hostname_or_config_alias
```
If the XDebug runs within a Docker containter in the server setup a the tunnel with the command:

```
ssh -R \*:9000:localhost:9000 server_ip_hostname_or_config_alias
```
Which makes the tunnel open to the public. 

#### Allow Remote connection 
> By default, OpenSSH only allows connecting to remote forwarded ports from the server host
Edit the `sshd_config`
```
sudo joe /etc/ssh/sshd_config
```
Set
```
GatewayPorts yes
```
And restart SSH
```
sudo service ssh restart
```
Confirm that port `9000` accepts connection from any host

Run
```
sudo netstat -plnt
```
And confirm that you get `0.0.0.0` in the Local Address.
```
Proto Recv-Q Send-Q Local Address           Foreign Address         State       PID/Program name    
tcp        0      0 0.0.0.0:9000            0.0.0.0:*               LISTEN      49998/sshd: skounis 
```
#### Test the tunnel 
In the local machine start a server that is listening to port `9000`
```
nc -l 9000
```

In the server connect to port `9000` and send some messages (text) 
```
nc localhost 2399
```

Any character we type should apear in the terminal in the local machine.
